title: Github pricing page with Tailwind CSS
---

A replication of the Github pricing page using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Tailwind appears to divide opinion but I really like working with it. I found I could achieve quality results far quicker than I could trying to hand roll a responsive design. I would love to try Tailwind on a real project.

I did this a while ago (6th June 2018), so the Github pricing page has changed and Tailwind has also advanced, but these replications show how it used to look.

You can see the <a href="/github-pricing-page-using-tailwind-css/index.html" target="_blank">demo here</a> or mess around on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ScottWhittaker/pen/PaGZMO). The screenshot below shows the demo on a mobile device.
