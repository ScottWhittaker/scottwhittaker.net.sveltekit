Very nice [Commit Guidelines](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-guidelines) which I found via [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/) some time ago.

A related older post about [semantic commit messages](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages), which I often revisit, is what initially caught my interest in a more rigid approach to commit messages.

That's it.
