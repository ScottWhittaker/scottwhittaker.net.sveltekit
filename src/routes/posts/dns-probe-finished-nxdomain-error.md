title: DNS probe finished nxdomain error
---

I encountered a very frustrating issue for the first time ever when trying to load [svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev/). No matter which browser I used the site would not load and chrome reported a `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN` error. I tried all sorts of recommended fixes such as changing DNS servers in network settings and flushing the DNS cache but none of them worked (on a mac).

Eventually I stumbled across [this post](https://andycroll.com/ruby/clean-up-broken-dev-domains-after-puma-dns_probe_finished_nxdomain/) which at first did not appear relevant as it was related to `puma-dev` which I am not familiar with. However, I noticed the following...

```shell
# Remove local overwritten resolver for .dev
rm /etc/resolver/dev
# Restart and clear the Mac OS X DNS resolver
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

Just out of interest I took a look at that file `/etc/resolver/dev` on my machine and found...

```shell
# Lovingly generated by Pow
nameserver 127.0.0.1
port 20560
```

I don't ever recall doing anything with Pow but hey, it has taken over all `.dev` domains. I guess if I had tried loading another site with a `.dev` domain and seen the same issue I may have noticed a pattern - but I didn't.

I deleted that file and it resolved the issue, I can now get on with life and read about [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) at last.

## Update

I subsequently [found this post](https://superuser.com/questions/1413402/i-cant-visit-websites-that-have-dev-domain) via the [svelte FAQs](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/wiki/FAQ#is-sveltedev-down) which would have been pretty useful had I stumbled across it first. If only I had known about `scutil --dns` I could have saved hours.
